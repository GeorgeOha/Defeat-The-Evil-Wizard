# Defeat-The-Evil-Wizard

‚öîÔ∏è Python Battle Arena Game

-A turn-based Python text adventure game showcasing Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles ‚Äî inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and dynamic gameplay mechanics.

-Battle as a Warrior, Mage, Archer, or Paladin against the powerful Evil Wizard, using strategy, special abilities, and healing to survive!


Project Overview

This game demonstrates:

-Object-Oriented Programming Concepts

-Classes, inheritance, and method overriding

-Interactive Console Gameplay

-Choose actions, cast spells, block attacks, and heal

-Dynamic Combat System

-Randomized attacks, regeneration, and health tracking

-Polymorphism

-Each class has unique special abilities and defensive tactics

OOP Concepts Demonstrated
‚úÖ Inheritance

Each character subclass (Warrior, Mage, Archer, Paladin) inherits from the base Character class.

‚úÖ Polymorphism

Each subclass implements unique special and defensive methods.

‚úÖ Encapsulation

Health, attack power, and state (blocking, healing) are managed inside each class.

‚úÖ Abstraction

The player interacts only with high-level methods like attack(), heal(), or display_stats().

Features to Try:

-Play multiple rounds using different classes

-Experiment with different ability combinations

-Observe how defense blocks attacks

-Try to finish with full health for a perfect victory

Requirements:

-Python 3.8 or higher

-No external dependencies (only uses the built-in random module)

 Future Enhancements:

-Add multiplayer or AI opponents

-Introduce mana or stamina systems

-Implement leveling and experience gain

-Save player stats between games
